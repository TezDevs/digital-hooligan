# System Operationalization
Digital Hooligan LLC

## Purpose

This document defines how the Attention → Conversion system
is used in practice.

It is an operating manual, not a strategy document.

The goal is to make the system easy to use,
easy to maintain,
and easy to ignore when not needed.

## Canonical Public Artifacts

These artifacts are public-facing and stable.

### 1. The Deep Dive (Attention)

- Lives on the Digital Hooligan site
- Referenced, not rewritten
- Updated rarely and intentionally

Use it when:
- Someone asks how you think
- Context is needed before a conversation
- Credibility matters more than speed

Do not:
- Re-explain its contents verbally
- Summarize it repeatedly
- Apologize for its length

---

### 2. Offer Framing

- Lives publicly in docs or About section
- Linked when someone asks “what do you do?”
- Never pushed proactively

Use it when:
- Someone is curious but vague
- You want to set boundaries calmly
- You want the other person to self-select

---

## Semi-Public / Reference Artifacts

These may be shared selectively.

### 3. Conversion → Attention to Conversation

- Used internally
- Referenced implicitly, not linked
- Guides how you respond, not what you send

This governs tone and behavior,
not messaging.

---

### 4. Light-Touch Next Step

- Used internally
- Explained conversationally when relevant
- Never sent as a formal document unless asked

This is a *default*, not a requirement.

---

## How You Use This System Day-to-Day

### When someone reacts to content

1. Acknowledge briefly
2. Ask one clarifying question
3. Do nothing else

Let curiosity pull forward.

---

### When someone asks “what do you do?”

1. Answer in one sentence
2. If needed, point to offer framing
3. Stop there

Do not expand unless invited.

---

### When a conversation feels aligned

1. Name the alignment
2. Offer the light-touch diagnostic as an option
3. Make it explicitly optional

Silence afterward is acceptable.

---

## What You Do Not Maintain

You do not:
- Track leads
- Nurture pipelines
- Follow up automatically
- Optimize for conversion rates

This system is designed for **fit**, not scale.

---

## Review Cadence

Quarterly check:
- Does this still feel natural?
- Are conversations better, not more frequent?
- Is anything becoming performative?

If something feels heavy, remove it.

## Status

Locked as the operational model
for Digital Hooligan’s
Attention → Conversion system.
