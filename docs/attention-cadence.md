# Attention → Cadence & Publishing Rhythm
Digital Hooligan LLC

## Purpose

This document defines the sustainable publishing cadence
for the Attention phase.

Cadence is not about volume.
It is about **consistency without exhaustion**.

If publishing creates pressure, the cadence is wrong.

---

## Core Principle

Digital Hooligan publishes **only when there is signal**.

Silence is acceptable.
Low-signal content is not.

---

## Baseline Cadence (Minimum Viable Presence)

This is the default operating rhythm.

### Monthly (Required)
- 1 Deep Dive **or** Postmortem

Purpose:
- Establish authority
- Create durable reference material

Signal:
“I do serious work and reflect on it.”

---

### Biweekly (Optional, Recommended)
- 1 Build Log **or** Field Note

Purpose:
- Show progress
- Stay present without overproduction

Signal:
“I’m actively building and thinking.”

---

### Ad Hoc (Optional)
- Position Pieces
- Strong opinions earned through experience

Purpose:
- Define boundaries
- Attract the right audience

Signal:
“I have a point of view.”

---

## Content Priority Order

When time or energy is limited, prioritize in this order:

1. Deep Dives / Postmortems
2. Build Logs
3. Field Notes
4. Position Pieces

If only one thing ships in a month, it should be #1.

---

## Definition of Done

A piece of Attention content is “done” when:

- It maps to one content pillar
- It maps to one content type
- It communicates a clear takeaway
- It would still be valuable in 6–12 months

Polish is secondary to clarity.

---

## Anti-Burnout Rules

The following are explicitly allowed:

- Skipping weeks
- Publishing less than planned
- Writing short instead of long
- Letting ideas mature before shipping

The following are explicitly disallowed:

- Guilt posting
- Trend chasing to “stay visible”
- Publishing content you wouldn’t reread later

---

## Review Cadence

Every quarter, reassess:

- Which content types felt energizing
- Which felt draining
- Which actually led to conversations or opportunities

Adjust cadence accordingly.

## Status

Locked as the authoritative cadence definition
for the Attention phase.
