# Conversion → Light Touch Next Step
Digital Hooligan LLC

## Purpose

This document defines the default next step
after a strong first conversation.

The goal is not to sell.
The goal is to **continue thinking together**
in a way that is useful, bounded, and optional.

## The Default Next Step: A Short Diagnostic

When a conversation feels aligned,
the natural next step is a short diagnostic engagement.

This is not a proposal.
It is not a project.
It is a focused thinking exercise.

---

## What the Diagnostic Is

A short, time-boxed engagement (usually days, not weeks)
designed to answer one question:

“What is actually going on here, and what decisions matter most?”

It typically includes:
- Clarifying the real problem (not just the symptoms)
- Mapping key decisions and constraints
- Identifying risks, tradeoffs, and blind spots
- Outlining possible paths forward

The output is a shared understanding,
not a build plan.

---

## What the Diagnostic Is Not

- Not staff augmentation
- Not implementation work
- Not a long-term commitment
- Not a disguised sales pitch

If nothing follows, the diagnostic still stands on its own.

---

## When This Step Makes Sense

This next step is appropriate when:
- The problem feels real but under-defined
- Decisions feel risky or stuck
- There is uncertainty about where to focus

If the problem is already fully specified,
this step may not add value.

---

## How It’s Framed in Conversation

Typical language (tone, not script):

“It sounds like there’s something real here.
A next step I sometimes suggest is a short diagnostic
to make the problem and decisions explicit.
If that’s useful, great.
If not, no pressure.”

No urgency.
No follow-up sequence.

---

## What Success Looks Like

Success is:
- Clearer decisions
- Reduced ambiguity
- Alignment on what matters

Success is not:
- Automatically turning into a project
- Maximizing scope
- Locking anyone in

---

## Status

Locked as the default light-touch
next step after initial conversations.
