# Attention → Sources
Digital Hooligan LLC

## Purpose

This document defines the approved source types used to earn attention,
trust, and credibility for Digital Hooligan content.

Sources are not citations for their own sake.
They are signals of real-world competence.

If a source does not increase trust with a technical buyer,
it does not belong here.

## Source Hierarchy (Highest → Lowest Trust)

### 1. Primary Sources (Highest Trust)

Work performed directly by Digital Hooligan.

Examples:
- Internal builds (apps, dashboards, APIs, embedded prototypes)
- Architecture decisions and tradeoffs
- Failure modes, bugs, and fixes
- Benchmarks, metrics, before/after results
- Postmortems and lessons learned

Rules:
- Preferred backbone of all content
- Explained in plain language
- Screenshots, diagrams, or code excerpts allowed

If a piece of content has no primary source,
it must justify why.

---

### 2. Practitioner Documentation

Documentation used by people who ship systems.

Examples:
- Official platform or vendor docs
- SDK / API references
- Hardware datasheets and specs
- RFCs, standards, and protocol definitions

Rules:
- Used to validate decisions
- Never quoted blindly
- Always contextualized with practical impact

Documentation is evidence, not authority by itself.

---

### 3. Industry Signal & Shared Reality

Widely accepted practices defining the current landscape.

Examples:
- Incident response frameworks
- Reliability and observability patterns
- Security baselines
- Common architecture models

Rules:
- Used for orientation, not hand-waving
- If controversial, say so
- If outdated, say so

---

### 4. Inspiration & Secondary Commentary (Lowest Trust)

Used sparingly and never as a foundation.

Examples:
- Blog posts
- Talks
- Opinion pieces
- Community discussions

Rules:
- Framing only
- Never the core justification
- Content must stand without them

---

## Explicitly Disallowed Sources

Not valid foundations:

- SEO listicles
- Beginner tutorials without original insight
- Influencer summaries without firsthand experience
- Rewritten docs with no added value

May only be referenced for critique or contrast.

---

## Source Reuse Strategy

Every source should be reusable across:

- Blog posts
- Docs
- Internal demos
- Talks or presentations
- Capability or sales discussions

Each source should answer at least one:
- What broke?
- What changed?
- Why this decision?
- What tradeoff was accepted?
- What would we do differently?

---

## Quality Gate

Before publishing Attention content:

- At least one Primary or Practitioner source exists
- Sources are current and relevant
- No credibility theater
- Content survives without external links

If this gate fails, the content does not ship.

---

## Status

Locked as the authoritative source policy
for the Attention phase.
