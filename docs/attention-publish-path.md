# Attention → Publish Path
Digital Hooligan LLC

## Purpose

This document defines where and how Attention-phase content
is published, starting with the first Deep Dive.

Publishing is treated as **placement**, not promotion.

The goal is to make the work findable by the right people,
not visible to everyone.

---

## Primary Home (Canonical)

### Digital Hooligan Website

This Deep Dive lives first and permanently on the
Digital Hooligan site.

Why:
- Full control of presentation
- Durable, linkable reference
- Signals seriousness and ownership

Rules:
- This is the canonical version
- All other instances point back here
- Updates happen here first

Expectation:
- Low traffic
- High signal readers
- Long shelf life

---

## Secondary Surfaces (Selective)

### LinkedIn (Introduction Only)

Used for:
- A short framing post
- One clear idea from the piece
- A link back to the canonical version

Rules:
- Do not summarize the whole article
- Do not thread the content
- Do not chase engagement

Expectation:
- A few thoughtful reactions
- Quiet recognition from the right readers

---

### GitHub (Optional, Contextual)

Used when:
- The piece relates directly to a repo
- It supports architectural or design decisions

Form:
- Link from README or docs
- No reposting of the full content

Expectation:
- Technical credibility
- Asynchronous discovery

---

## Explicitly Not Used (For This Piece)

This Deep Dive will **not** be published as:

- Twitter/X threads
- Medium articles
- Dev.to reposts
- Newsletter blasts
- SEO-optimized blog spam

Reason:
This content is not designed for fast consumption
or algorithmic amplification.

---

## Publishing Sequence (Important)

1. Publish on Digital Hooligan site
2. Let it sit for at least 24–48 hours
3. Share a single framing post on LinkedIn
4. Reference organically when relevant

No same-day cross-posting.
No urgency language.

## What Success Looks Like

Success is **not**:
- Page views
- Likes
- Shares

Success *is*:
- Someone referencing the piece later
- A thoughtful DM or email
- Recognition in conversation (“I read that…”)
- The piece becoming a quiet calling card

If none of that happens immediately, that’s fine.
This is long-term signal.

---

## Maintenance

- Revisit the piece quarterly
- Update only if something meaningfully changes
- Do not rewrite for trends or SEO

Stability builds trust.

---

## Status

Locked as the publishing strategy
for the first Attention-phase Deep Dive.
