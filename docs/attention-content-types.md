# Attention → Content Types
Digital Hooligan LLC

## Purpose

This document defines the approved content types used during the
Attention phase.

Content types are **delivery mechanisms** for the content pillars.
Each type has a clear job and a clear signal it sends to the reader.

If a piece of content does not clearly fit a type,
it does not ship.

---

## Content Type 1 — Build Logs

What this is:
- Ongoing documentation of building real systems

Used for:
- Showing progress
- Demonstrating decision-making in motion
- Making work visible without polishing it to death

Examples:
- “Week 1 building the CEO dashboard”
- “First pass at an edge AI prototype”
- “Why this integration broke on day three”

Signal sent:
“I actually build things.”

Primary pillars:
- Building Real Systems
- Applied R&D and Prototyping

---

## Content Type 2 — Postmortems

What this is:
- Honest analysis of failures, mistakes, or surprises

Used for:
- Teaching through failure
- Demonstrating ownership and maturity
- Sharing lessons without blame

Examples:
- Incident breakdowns
- Architectural missteps
- Performance regressions

Signal sent:
“I own outcomes, not just wins.”

Primary pillars:
- Owning the Outcome
- Tradeoffs, Not Absolutes

---

## Content Type 3 — Deep Dives

What this is:
- Focused explanations of a specific system, decision, or pattern

Used for:
- Teaching practitioners
- Clarifying complex systems
- Building long-term reference material

Examples:
- System architecture walkthroughs
- Metric and alerting strategies
- Edge vs cloud tradeoff analysis

Signal sent:
“I understand this deeply.”

Primary pillars:
- Operational Clarity
- Tradeoffs, Not Absolutes

---

## Content Type 4 — Field Notes

What this is:
- Short, high-signal observations from real work

Used for:
- Sharing insights without long-form writing
- Capturing patterns as they emerge
- Staying present without noise

Examples:
- “One thing I learned today…”
- “A pattern I keep seeing in dashboards…”
- “A mistake teams repeat with monitoring…”

Signal sent:
“I pay attention.”

Primary pillars:
- Operational Clarity
- Owning the Outcome

---

## Content Type 5 — Position Pieces

What this is:
- Clearly stated opinions grounded in experience

Used for:
- Defining boundaries
- Attracting the right audience
- Repelling the wrong one

Examples:
- “Why most dashboards fail operators”
- “Why more tools rarely fix ops problems”
- “Why prototypes matter more than plans”

Signal sent:
“I have a point of view, and it’s earned.”

Primary pillars:
- Tradeoffs, Not Absolutes
- Operational Clarity

---

## What We Explicitly Do NOT Publish

Digital Hooligan avoids:

- Generic tutorials
- Trend summaries
- Tool reviews without real usage
- Motivational content without substance

If it smells like content marketing,
it does not ship.

---

## Mapping Rule

Every piece of Attention content must:

- Map to **one content type**
- Map to **one primary pillar**
- Declare both during drafting

If this mapping is unclear,
the content is rejected.

---

## Status

Locked as the authoritative content type definition
for the Attention phase.
