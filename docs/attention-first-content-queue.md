# Attention → First Content Queue
Digital Hooligan LLC

## Purpose

This document defines the first set of Attention content
to be created and published by Digital Hooligan.

This queue prioritizes:
- Authority over reach
- Signal over volume
- Learning over polish

The goal is not to go viral.
The goal is to be recognized.

---

## Queue Principles

Each piece must:
- Map to one primary content pillar
- Map to one content type
- Be grounded in real work or real decisions
- Teach something that would have helped “past us”

Order matters. Do not skip ahead.
