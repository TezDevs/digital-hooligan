# Most Dashboards Answer Questions Nobody Is Asking

Most dashboards don’t fail because the data is wrong.
They fail because they’re optimized to answer questions
nobody is asking in the moment that matters.

You can see this during incidents.

The dashboard is full.
Charts are updating.
Numbers are moving.

And yet the same question keeps coming up:
“What should we do right now?”

Instead of narrowing the problem,
the dashboard expands it.

Every metric invites interpretation.
Every graph suggests urgency.
Nothing makes the decision clearer.

This keeps happening for a simple reason:
dashboards are usually built by inventorying data,
not by naming decisions.

Teams ask:
“What can we show?”

But operators need:
“What choice am I being asked to make?”

The cost of this mismatch is subtle but real.

Decisions slow down.
Debates replace action.
Confidence erodes when signals conflict.

Over time, people stop trusting the dashboard
and rely on instinct instead.

The fix isn’t better charts.
It’s a different starting point.

When dashboards are designed around decisions,
clarity becomes intentional instead of accidental.

That shift—quiet but deliberate—
is what separates dashboards that look impressive
from ones that actually help.
